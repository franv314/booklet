# ICPC Booklet

This booklet aims at containing useful algorithm and data structure implementations for ICPC-like contests.

## Entries

Code contained in the booklet **must** be indented with tabs and be at most 48 columns wide (1 tab = 2 columns).

Using the implementations should be as straightforward as possible: everything should provide a public, self-explanatory API
where possible. Non public entities of interest should be commented.
If the usage is exceptionally obscure an usage section may be added in the booklet.
